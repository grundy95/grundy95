ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Thomas Grundy (Tom for short) and I'm a 3rd year statistics PhD student at the STOR-i Centre for Doctoral Training. I will be looking for work starting October 2021!

My research intrests include time series analysis; changepoint detection; high-dimensional statistics; forecasting and sequential monitoring of stochastic processes. 

I'm the author of a few R packages for changepoint detection - these can be found in my reposititries (usally named changepoint.*)

Iâ€™m currently expanding my python knowledge and undatking some personal data science projects (alongside finishing my PhD!) 

Please feel free to contact me via email t.grundy1@lancaster.ac.uk
